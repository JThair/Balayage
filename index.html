    <h1>Balayage Highlighting Technique</h1>
    <p>Balayage is a free-hand hair painting technique designed to give a soft, natural lift of 1–3 levels. Instead of applying lightener in foils, the bleach is brushed directly onto the surface of the hair, creating a sun-kissed effect.</p>
    <p>Think of it like spending time outdoors: the hair that’s exposed to the sun naturally becomes lighter, while the hidden layers underneath stay darker. This results in a dimensional, lived-in look with lighter tones framing the face and crown, and deeper shades underneath for contrast.</p>
    <p>Balayage looks especially stunning when styled with waves or curls, since the movement of the hair enhances the multi-tonal effect.</p>

    <div class="important">
      ⚠️ <strong>Important to note:</strong><br>
      Balayage is not intended for dramatic transformations on dark hair. If you want to go lighter by more than 3 levels, the <strong>Foilayage</strong> technique is the better option.
    </div>

    <h2>Process</h2>

    <div class="process-step">
      <strong>Application (≈ 45 minutes)</strong>
      The lightener is painted onto the hair in sweeping motions. Layers are separated using plastic films or cotton to keep everything neat and controlled.
    </div>

    <div class="process-step">
      <strong>Processing (1–1.5 hours)</strong>
      The hair develops under room temperature. For resistant or color-treated hair, very low heat may be used to help the lightener break through.
    </div>

    <div class="process-step">
      <strong>Rinse & Cleanse (≈ 15 minutes)</strong>
      Once processing is complete, the plastic or cotton is removed, and the hair is rinsed thoroughly. A rough shampoo removes the product to prep for toning.
    </div>

    <div class="process-step">
      <strong>Toning (20–30 minutes)</strong>
      This step is essential. Toning controls the natural warm pigments exposed by the lightener. It’s usually done right at the shampoo bowl on clean, towel-dried hair until the perfect shade is achieved.
    </div>

    <div class="process-step">
      <strong>Final Wash & Condition</strong>
      After toning, a second round of shampoo and a relaxing conditioning treatment follows to restore softness and shine.
    </div>

    <div class="process-step">
      <strong>Haircut & Styling</strong>
      Back at the chair, a haircut is performed if needed. Then comes product application, blow-drying, and adding curls or waves to bring out dimension.
    </div>

    <div class="process-step">
      <strong>Finishing Touch</strong>
      Final step — photos of your new look, and you head out the door as your beautiful new self.
    </div>

    <h2>Maintenance & Toner Refresh</h2>
    <p>Because balayage tones are created using demi-permanent color toners, they naturally fade over time with washing, sun exposure, and everyday buildup. To keep your color looking fresh and balanced, it’s highly recommended to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Come in once a month for an exfoliating shampoo to remove environmental and product buildup.</li>
      <li>Follow with a toner refresh to revive the tones, control warmth, and extend the life of your balayage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This simple upkeep helps maintain that natural, sun-kissed look and keeps your hair shiny, healthy, and dimensional in between major appointments.</p>
